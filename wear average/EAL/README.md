# EAL.py

This is a program that calculate the mean and standard deviation of the wire wear of EAL at each tension length on monthly bases.

The program takes in a .xlsx file of a EAL Cantenary Report. The EAL Cantenary Report.xlsx should contain 5 sheets (up, down, RAC up, RAC down, LOW S1).

## Before using the program
1. Make sure ```EAL.xlsx``` (the tension length lookup table) is in the correct directory.

## How to use the program
1. Change the current directory to the ```EAL Report``` folder, or move ```EAL.xlsx``` to your current directory (most likely your home directory).
2. Run the Python script.
3. Select the .xlsx EAL Cantenary Report to be analyzed.
4. When prompted, click ```Enter``` and select the location to store EAL Report.xlsx.
